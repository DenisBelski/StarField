# StarField
This project implemented a solution for demonstrating flight among the stars.

The density of stars and the speed of movement are hardcoded in the application. If you want to change these parameters, 
refer to the "stars" field to change the number of generated stars and to the "MoveStar" method, the "star.Z" parameter to change the speed.
Use ALT+F4 to exit the application.
